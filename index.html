            <h3>Apr 9, Friday</h3>
            <p>I just come back from a trip, so I stayed at home
                and watch those lecture recordings I have missed.
                It was so boring.</p>
            <p> The only interesting thing is that
                I had my lunch at a popular restaurant that cooks very
                traditional Beijing foods. It was delicious.</p>
            <p> I drove to that restaurant, and driving is really fun
                when you just got your license!</p>

            <h3>Apr 10, Saturday</h3>
            <p>The first half of Saturday was a <span style="color: red;">disaster!</span> I
                spent my whole time finishing <h6 class="display1">MCWP</h6>  ddls.</p>
            <p>MCWP 50 went against my wish at the very beginning of this quarter.
                I chose the section whose topic is crime, hoping that we could read books like Sherlock Holmes and write
                creative detective story.
            </p>
            <p>
                But actually, what we really need to write are research papers concerning crime rates, judicial system,
                etc.,
                which become another set of social science keywords that is <b>far from interesting.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                What's even worse, at the end of week 2, when nothing details of our final paper has been discussed, we
                were asked to determine
                the paper central topic and come up with a research question. <i>That tortured me, literally.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                No more <h6 class="display2">MCWP</h6> PLEASE! And if you ask me why I don't like MCWP, the answer is: it has <strong>all 3 things I dislike the
                    most.</strong>
            </p>

                Fortunately, today had a happy ending. After dinner, my friends Leo called me to join them and play
                Majong. <em>Awsome!</em>
                I had great fun playing and chatting with my friends. Also, I won a lot. <br>(We don't gamble of course,
                we
                just use chips
                to keep track of our scores.) And after the game ended in 1 am......

            <h3>Apr 11, Sunday</h3>
            <p>
                Yeah, it's a brand new day after the game! We decided to have a midnight supper. We chose a hotpot
                restaurant that won't close until 5 am. <br>
                After entering we started to realize why there exists restaurant till 5 am, because
                there are plenty of
                people like us at that time! I drove back home after the meal, and it was already 2:30 am.

                Now, I got up and started to crafting my CSE 110 Lab 2, a HTML web page.
